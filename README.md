# Titanic-Dataset-Task-2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Includes summary statistics, histograms, boxplots, correlation matrix, survival trend visualizations, and feature-level insights for identifying patterns in the data.
##  Objective ##
To analyze and explore the Titanic dataset using summary statistics and visualizations in order to draw insights about passenger survival.

##  Tools Used ##
 Python
 Pandas
 Matplotlib
 Seaborn

##  Key Steps Performed ##

1. Summary Statistics - Generated mean, median, standard deviation, and value counts for key features.

2. Histograms & Boxplots - Visualized distributions and outliers for `Age`, `Fare`, `SibSp`, and `Parch`.  
  
3. Correlation Analysis - Created a heatmap of numeric feature correlations to identify relationships.  

4. Pattern Discovery - Bar plots and violin plots were used to explore survival trends by sex, class, and age. 
  
5. Feature-Level Inferences  - Observed that female and 1st-class passengers had higher survival rates.
                             - Younger passengers had better survival chances compared to older ones.

##  Dataset ##
 Titanic Dataset (`Titanic-Dataset.csv`) from [Kaggle Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
